### Phase 1: Finalize and Containerize Your Microservices

- Finalize Your Microservices
- Ensure both user-service (Python + MongoDB) and order-service (Go + PostgreSQL) are functional and testable locally.
- Dockerize Each Service
- Create Dockerfile for both services.
- Use multi-stage builds for Go; python:3.9-slim or similar for Python.
- Add Docker Compose (optional for local testing)
- Compose file to spin up both services + MongoDB + PostgreSQL.

### Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

- Choose Cloud Provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure — let's assume AWS)
- Use Terraform to Provision Cloud Resources
- VPC, subnets
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- RDS for PostgreSQL
- EC2 or managed MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- S3 bucket (optional for logs or backups)
- IAM roles and security groups
- Write Modular Terraform
- Separate modules for networking, eks, rds, etc.
- Use terraform-aws-modules where possible for reusability.

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Setup
- Prepare Kubernetes Manifests
- Deployment and Service YAMLs for each microservice
- Use ConfigMaps or Secrets for DB URIs
- Add health checks (readiness and liveness probes)
- Optional: Add Ingress + cert-manager if exposing externally
- Push Docker Images
- Build and push your images to a container registry (e.g., ECR or Docker Hub)
- Deploy to EKS
- kubectl apply -f your manifests or use Helm charts
- Verify service connectivity (e.g., user-service → order-service)

### Phase 4: Observability (Pre-Chaos Setup)

- Install Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- Loki or ELK for logs
- Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for tracing (optional)
- Set Up Alerts
- Basic alerts on pod restarts, high latency, DB disconnections, etc.

### Phase 5: Chaos Engineering

- Introduce Chaos Tools
- Install LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh in your cluster
- Define chaos experiments like:
    - Kill pod randomly
    - Delay network to DB
    - High CPU/memory usage
    - Disk full
    - Node failures

- Run Chaos Scenarios
- Start with light chaos: e.g., pod delete
- Monitor system behavior and recovery
- Gradually increase complexity
- Automate Chaos Runs
- Define schedules and integrate with CI/CD if needed

### What's Next

- Add Load Testing (Locust, k6)
- Add Canary or Blue/Green Deployments
- Introduce CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, etc.)
